# Compositional Protocol Proof — Lean 4 Formal Verification

## Philosophy — READ THIS FIRST

**This is a protocol verification project.** The mathematical structures (StepOrdering, TransGen, LinLink) represent REAL protocol communication between cache coherence agents. They are NOT abstract math to be manipulated mechanically.

### The #1 rule: ALWAYS think about what the protocol relations MEAN

Before proving, composing, or sorry-ing ANYTHING:
1. **Ask: what PPOi/rfe/co/fr edge types produce this case?** Each edge has specific protocol semantics (reads-from, coherence order, etc.)
2. **Ask: what events are involved? Are they reads or writes?** FR(e₁,e₂) needs e₁.isRead, e₂.isWrite. Many edge pairs are IMPOSSIBLE at junctions (FR+FR, co+FR, rfe+rfe) because the junction event can't be both read AND write.
3. **Ask: is this case even possible in the protocol?** If not → it's vacuous → prove `exfalso`. Don't waste hours trying to compose something that can't arise.
4. **Use full protocol evidence** (hedge, edge sub-cases, read/write constraints, sameProtocol) in proofs. Don't rely on abstract mathematical composition alone — it loses critical protocol information.

### Key examples
- **FR + FR is IMPOSSIBLE**: e₂ can't be both read and write → edge pair vacuous
- **obFinishBefore + .ob is VACUOUS**: .ob only from same-cluster edges (l₂=l₃), obFinishBefore has l₁≠l₂ → l₁≠l₃ contradicts same-protocol assumption
- **Derive protocol BEFORE matches**: Lean's `match` breaks type bridging. Move protocol derivations before `match hfc : l₁, ...`

### Codebase philosophy
- Definitions validated by Murphi model checking. **Never add new axioms.** Prove from existing definitions.
- Descriptive definitions carry mechanism (WHAT happened), not just consequences. The ordering is DERIVED.
- dir_ordered is model over-strength (orders ALL directory events). Only valid for same-cluster, same-address.

## Rules

1. **Understand first, prove second.** Walk through the proof in text before formalizing.
2. **Read the actual definition.** Grep and read source. Never assume.
3. **Consider all cases.** `dirAccessOfRequest` has 3 cases, `linearizationEventOfRequest` has 2, etc.
4. **Never add new axioms.** Case-split on existing inductive types.
5. **Verify proofs are not vacuous.** Check hypotheses are satisfiable, conclusions nontrivial.
6. **Search the codebase first** before flagging open questions.

## Current goal: Herd CMCM acyclicity proof

Prove `acyclic(PPOi ∪ rfe ∪ fr ∪ co)` in `CMCM/Herd/Proof.lean`.

### Status (updated 2026-04-02)
- **compoundLin lifting COMPLETE (2 sorry'd declarations, main chain sorry-free)**:
  - `cmcm_acyclic_of_hknow_compoundLin`: SORRY-FREE ✓
  - `compose_three_compoundLin`: SORRY-FREE ✓
  - `step_ordering_dir_ordered_3way_compoundLin`: SORRY-FREE ✓
  - `step_to_ordering_compoundLin`: SORRY-FREE ✓
  - `compoundLin_cle_of_dirLin`: SORRY-FREE ✓ (Rf.lean, ZERO sorry's)
  - `compoundLin_diff_protocol`: SORRY-FREE ✓ (modulo 1 inside+inside genuine impossibility)
  - `cle_ne_compoundLin_prot`: SORRY-FREE ✓
  - `cluster_cache_ne_global`: SORRY-FREE ✓
  - `rfe` structure: added `notDown₁`/`notDown₂` fields
  - 2 sorry'd declarations remain (non-critical):
    - `stepOrdering_to_three`: 4 sorry's for reverse sub-cases of new constructors (CLE proof only)
    - `step_ordering_cle_to_compoundLin`: bridge sorry's (ne_global call site args + dead code + inside+inside diff_prot impossibility)
- **`dirAccessUnique` REMOVED** from `CompoundProtocol` — it was unused.
- **Architecture**: `cmcm_acyclic_of_hknow` uses CLEs from `hknow` directly (`hreq's_dir_access.choose`). The CLE-to-compound_lin bridge was eliminated.
  - **PPOi (single edge)**: `dir_ordered` gives 3-way on CLEs (same-cluster directory events). No compound_lin needed.
  - **COM (single edge)**: `step_to_ordering` gives StepOrdering on CLEs directly. No bridge needed.
  - **Composition**: `compose_three` handles all StepOrdering/eq/reverseOB × PPOi/COM cases.
  - **`cmcm_acyclic_of_hknow` is sorry-free!** Delegates to compose_three.
- **compose_three**: SORRY-FREE. Uses dir_ordered fallback for hard cases (all CLEs are directory events → always resolvable).
- **StepOrdering enriched**: `obEndLt`, `encapObEndLt`, `obFinishBefore` all carry `h_p_isdir`.
- **Non-lazy PPOi**: `h_non_lazy_ppoi` hypothesis excludes lazy RCC.
- **Dead code**: CLE-to-compound_lin bridge removed. `ppoi_diff_addr_step_ordering` deleted.
- **`cdirEncapsDown_exists`**: `h_dir_coherent` parameter removed; onDirVd proved inline with consistent e_r_gdown. sameProtocol chain proved via `correspondingCluster_protocol_eq`. Proof.lean call sites cleaned.
- **`cacheEvent_Vd_transition_isNcWeakWrite`**: SORRY-FREE via ValidRequest Subtype match.
- **RfCase files**: Fixed `rCleOrDownAtWAfterWCle.diffCluster` pattern match (missing 3rd field after `wObRDown` was added).

### TODO
1. **CO Theorem**: Implement a CO theorem that PROVES `co.ordering` from protocol axioms. Note: this is NOT a carbon copy of `RfTheorem` — `readsFrom.cases` requires `isRead` for the second event, but CO has two writes. The CO theorem needs its own type structure. `CoTheorem.lean` is currently a placeholder.
2. **Dead code cleanup**: Remove marked-as-DEAD functions in RfProofHelpers.lean.
3. **CompoundLin lifting (IN PROGRESS)**: Framework done (compoundLin def, bridge, proxy constructors). Next: finish bridge sorry's → compose_three_compoundLin → cmcm_acyclic_compoundLin. Key: compoundLin always related to CLE via compoundLin_cle_rel; dir_ordered goes through CLEs.
4. **compose_three_compoundLin**: The reverse case in dir_ordered is a PROOF ARTIFACT. The protocol guarantees forward ordering — composition of two forward edges MUST give forward (causality). The RIGHT approach: handle all stuck composition pairs EXPLICITLY, deriving forward from specific StepOrdering constructors + edge evidence. This eliminates the reverse case and dir_ordered fallback. Produces clean 2-way invariant (StepOrdering or eq). The CLE proofs dir_ordered is an overapproximation introducing a spurious reverse case.
5. **Key rule**: Use `Event n` with `isDirectoryEvent` prop, NEVER `DirectoryEvent` directly. Don't use `DirectoryEvent.eReq`. Match existing Behaviour proof patterns. ALWAYS document WHY a sublemma exists.

### Lessons learned (BE INTROSPECTIVE!)
- **Don't guess constructors.** Each new StepOrdering constructor multiplies case analysis. Use edge data instead.
- **Information loss is the enemy.** `step_to_ordering` strips rich edge evidence. Keep original edge data available.
- **Sorry checklist (RUN THIS FIRST before any sorry fix)**:
  1. Is it a bug introduced by a previous commit? Check git history — revert if so.
  2. Is the issue resolved by looking at the upper level theorem context? Does the caller actually need this?
  3. Are you stuck in a rabbit hole? If >15 min without code progress, STOP, draw a picture, explain simply.
- **Check the context of the proof that CONSTRUCTS the sorry'd structure.** If the sorry needs X, the construction site probably already HAS X but doesn't store it. Adding a field is trivial — the construction already provides it. Example: `noEvictBetween` needed `CLE_w OB cdir`. The RF theorem already knew this (it's implicit in `noWriteBtn` operating between CLE_w and cdir) — just not stored as a field. Adding `wCleObCdir` compiled immediately with zero changes to construction sites.
- **After matching on Event constructor, derive CacheEvent-level hypotheses.** Event-level hypotheses (e.g., `hacq_req : Event.req n e = ...`) don't reduce inside `match e with | .cacheEvent ce => ...` because the match changes the term but not the hypothesis. Fix: derive `hce_req : ce.req = ...` by `simpa [Event.req] using hacq_req` AFTER the match. Same for `Event.down` → `ce.down`. This was the key to fixing the Lemma6 sorry.
- **Case-split BEFORE simp chains, not after.** If a proof depends on a case distinction (e.g., cache state = Vd vs non-Vd), do the match FIRST, then run the simp chain inside each branch with the concrete value. Running simp first with an abstract value consumes the pattern, making later case-splits ineffective. Example: Lemma6 needed cache state match before `reqToDirOfRequestEvent` simp.
- **`by_cases protocol` is the universal first move.** Same → dir_ordered. Diff → .obFinishBefore.
- **Derive equalities BEFORE matches.** After `match hfc : l₁, ...`, rw fails on pre-match hypotheses.
- **Don't expand wildcards without a closure plan.** Creates MORE sorry's.
- **Commit clean states, revert fast** when sorry count increases.
- **`let` bindings block `▸` and `rw`**: In `cmcm_acyclic_of_hknow`, the `let cle` binding prevents `▸` from finding patterns through the expansion. Use `Eq.subst` with explicit motive (`@Eq.subst _ (fun x => ...) _ _ heq h`) instead.
- **dir_ordered is the UNIVERSAL fallback**: All CLEs from `hreq's_dir_access.choose` are directory events (`isDirEvent`). `step_ordering_dir_ordered_3way` resolves ANY pair of CLEs. Use this when StepOrdering composition gets stuck. The CLE-to-compound_lin bridge was ELIMINATED by using CLEs directly + dir_ordered for PPOi.
- **CLE-to-compound_lin bridge is fundamentally flawed**: CLE ordering doesn't always imply compound_lin ordering (for clusterCacheLin + encapDir/orderAfterDir, bounds are reversed). The right approach: use CLEs directly in the cycle invariant.
- **`induction` generalizes indices**: When inducting on `TransGen R a c`, Lean generalizes `c`. Use `_` or `hknow _` to let Lean infer the generalized endpoint.
- **State→Event bridge needs protocol axioms**: `List.stateAfter` tracks entry states (EntryState = State ⊕ DirectoryState). Directory events have `eReq : CacheEvent` but proving `eReq ∈ b` requires `cacheEncapsulatesCorrespondingDirEvent.reqInB` which needs CompoundProtocol. Similarly, cache events at directory entries need `isClusterCache` which requires knowing the struct is cluster-level. Don't try to bridge state-level facts to event-level conclusions without protocol axioms in scope.
- **`Trans.trans` for OB chains**: `Event.instTransOrderOrder` handles OB transitivity (chains through `oWellFormed`). Use `Trans.trans h₁ h₂` not `Nat.lt_trans`.
- **Think from the RELATION's perspective, not the event's**: For RF (write→read), the downgrade directory event at the writer's cluster represents the READ side of the communication, NOT a write-back. I got stuck thinking about what the WRITER does (writes back data) instead of what the DIRECTORY EVENT represents (processing the READ request). The `existsRClusterDirDown` should use `isDirRead` because the directory event at the writer's cluster is a read downgrade. **Root cause**: I was reasoning about cache-level operations (write-back) instead of directory-level semantics (processing the incoming read). The directory event's request type matches the INCOMING request (read), not the cache operation (write-back).
- **Use `isDirMatchingRW` (rw-matching) instead of `isDirWrite`/`isDirRead`**: When a definition is used by both RF (write→read) and CO (write→write) relations, don't hardcode `isDirWrite` or `isDirRead`. Instead use `isDirMatchingRW` (`de.req.val.rw = e.req.val.rw`) which adapts to the relation: for RF it requires a read dir event (matching the reader), for CO it requires a write dir event (matching the writer). **This is the SECOND time the user suggested this pattern** — the first time I went through isDirWrite→isDirRead→removing the field entirely before the user pointed out the clean solution. **Root lesson**: when multiple protocol cases need different constraints, find the PARAMETRIC version that captures what the protocol actually does (the dir event's rw matches the request that triggered the downgrade) rather than hardcoding one case.
- **`grantRels` was a false shortcut (REVERTED)**: The old `encapGrantAfterDirEvent` had contradictory fields. After the user fixed it (grant is last encapsulated event: `e_grant.oEnd + 1 = e_req.oEnd`), those exfalso proofs broke. **Lesson**: never use axiom artifacts to close cases — always reason about what the protocol actually does.
- **Axiom structure encoding creates vacuity traps**: Axioms like `nonCohReqDowngrades` embed preconditions (e.g., `reqDirOnSW : state = SW`) as FIELDS rather than guards. When preconditions fail (state = Vd ≠ SW), the structure is uninhabitable → axiom vacuously True → field extraction gives False. This is the SAME pattern as grantRels. **Always check**: is the axiom structure genuinely inhabited for the specific events you're applying it to? If any field is False for your inputs, the extraction is vacuous.
- **Dir state coherence from `dirAccessOfRequest`**: To prove dir state ≠ Vd (e.g., `onDirVd` vacuous), case-split on e_w's `dirAccessOfRequest`: `encapDir` → coherent request → dir at SW; `orderBeforeDir` → predecessor had perms, `hinter_leaves_state_at_least` prevents any intermediate event from downgrading coherent perms, so if anything changed dir to Vd it would have violated the state preservation; `orderAfterDir` → NC weak on Vd (implies NC weak READ, likely contradicts e_w.isWrite at call sites). Key insight: "if another access changed the directory to Vd, it would have downgraded the orderBeforeDir's coherent write permissions" — the `hinter_leaves_state_at_least` constraint is the proof mechanism.
- **`isDirDownRW` replaces `isDirMatchingRW`**: Inductive with `readDown` (dir rw=.r) and `writeDown` (dir rw=.w, Vd writeback). Provable by case-splitting on dir event's rw. The old `isDirMatchingRW` (exact equality with CLE) was unprovable in `noGlobalCache` case because CLE.rw comes from a predecessor that could be a write.
- **`Vd ≤ SW` is TRUE** (same perms `some .wr`, different coherence `false ≤ true`). Cannot derive dir ≠ Vd from simple `≤` comparison with SW cache. Need coherence BIT argument: coherent perms require `c=true`, Vd has `c=false`.
- **compoundLin events are ALWAYS related to CLEs** via compoundLin_cle_rel (eq/cle_ob/ob_cle/inside). NEVER forget this when reasoning about compoundLin. dir_ordered can ALWAYS be applied to CLEs (directory events), then chained to compoundLin via proxy constructors. This is the FUNDAMENTAL technique for the compoundLin lifting.
- **reverseOB in 3-way invariant**: Legitimate intermediate state from dir_ordered giving "wrong" direction. Can't be contradicted locally — resolved at cycle closure (l OB l → False). For PPOi: compoundLin version uses h_non_lazy_ppoi directly (no dir_ordered needed). For stuck composition: dir_ordered on CLEs may give reverse. The reverse bridge (CLE₂ OB CLE₁ → compoundLin₂ OB compoundLin₁) is needed but has the same structure as the forward bridge.
- **WRITE DOWN important information and lessons in CLAUDE.md IMMEDIATELY.** Don't rely on memory across sessions or even within a session. If you discover a key insight (like "compoundLin is always related to CLE"), write it here RIGHT NOW. Forgotten insights cause hours of wasted work going in circles. The cost of writing is seconds; the cost of forgetting is hours.
- **PLAN proofs using protocol meaning and upper-level context BEFORE implementing.** Don't grind through sorry's mechanically. Ask: what does this case MEAN in the protocol? What does the caller need? What evidence is available? A 10-minute planning session saves hours of case-analysis grinding. The compoundLin lifting was stuck for hours until planning revealed that dir_ordered goes through CLEs — a fact obvious from the protocol meaning but invisible from the Lean types alone.
- **Resolve uncertain parts of a plan FIRST — this is the DEFAULT approach for any non-trivial proof.** Before investing in large mechanical work, ALWAYS: (1) sketch the full plan, (2) identify which lemmas/theorems have uncertain feasibility, (3) write and test those uncertain parts FIRST, (4) only then do the mechanical work. For compoundLin lifting: testing `cle_self_ordering_false` at cycle closure took 5 minutes and confirmed the approach. Without this check, 500 lines of `compose_three` duplication could have been wasted if cycle closure failed. This is now the DEFAULT workflow: plan → identify uncertainties → resolve uncertainties → execute.
- **Implement foundational fixes, not band-aids.** The reverse case in StepOrdering's 3-way invariant was a band-aid for `dir_ordered` giving the "wrong" direction. Band-aids create technical debt that compounds. A foundational fix pays off immediately and prevents future blockers. ALWAYS ask: "Is this a band-aid or a real fix?" before implementing.
- **Examine NOW vs LATER for fixes.** Before punting a fix, reason: (1) Will doing it later require MORE work because I'll build on the band-aid? (2) Does the band-aid block or complicate the next step? (3) How much work is the fix NOW vs the rework LATER? The reverse case example: writing compose_three WITH reverse and THEN removing it = double work. Writing it WITHOUT reverse from the start = once. The fix should have been done FIRST. Make this examination automatic.
- **Write code first, analyze later.** When facing a sorry, just try to fill it with code, build, iterate. Don't write paragraphs theorizing about feasibility. Most sorry's are mechanical once you start writing. BUT: this rule applies to INDIVIDUAL sorry's after the plan is clear. Don't apply it to the OVERALL approach — that needs planning first.
- **Match on ValidRequest (Subtype), not on individual fields**: `RequestState`/`DowngradeState`/`MRS` match on the full `ValidRequest` Subtype `⟨⟨rw, coh, con⟩, hv⟩`, NOT on individual fields. Matching on `ce.req.val.rw`, `ce.req.val.coherent` etc. separately doesn't give Lean enough info to reduce the Subtype match. **Fix**: `match hvr : ce.req with | ⟨⟨.w, false, .Weak⟩, _⟩ => ...` then `rw [hvr] at hs_Vd` to substitute before `simp [ValidRequest.RequestState]`. Lean uses `IsValid'` for exhaustiveness — invalid request patterns (like `⟨_, false, .SC⟩`) are auto-excluded.
- **`simp only` vs `simp` for `if` reduction**: `simp only [...]` does NOT include `ite_true`/`ite_false`, so `if True then x else y` won't reduce. Use `simp [...]` (without `only`) to include default simp lemmas, or add `ite_true`/`ite_false` explicitly.
- **`lin(dir_event)` gives False for directory events**: `dirAccessOfRequest` constructors are designed for cache events. For a directory event: `encapDir` has `dirOfReq` = False (isDirEventOfReqEvent is false for (dir,dir)); `orderBeforeDir` has `hnot_down` which contradicts `down=true` for downgrades; `orderAfterDir` has `reqCache` = False (dir events aren't cache events). Use this pattern to derive `exfalso` whenever a directory event appears in `lin(e)`. This solved onDirVd and the cdir OB CLE_w temporal contradiction.
- **Read definitions immediately, don't guess.** `reqToDirOfRequestEvent` is 5 lines — read it instead of speculating about what it does. `grep -rn 'def ...'` is faster than reasoning from names.
- **Search the codebase aggressively for existing lemmas.** Key finds: `directory_event_is_bottom`, `bottom_e_in_b_impl_in_eventsAtEntryOfListBottomEvents`, `eventsUpToEvent_ordered_before_sorted`, `eventsUpToEntry_at_e_entry`. Always search before writing new code.
- **Extract helper lemmas proactively for heartbeat management.** `dirEvent_down_true_ne_Vd_of_ne_Vd` extraction solved a timeout. `list_stateAfter_exists_transition_with_inv` carried the invariant cleanly. Don't let proofs grow past ~30 lines without extracting.
- **NEVER use `DirectoryEvent` directly or `DirectoryEvent.eReq`**: Use `Event n` with `isDirectoryEvent` prop, matching the rest of the codebase. The `eReq` field has NO axioms linking it to the dir event's properties (no sameProtocol, no sameDown, no Encapsulates). Use CLE/lin infrastructure instead to get corresponding cache events with full protocol properties via `cacheEncapsulatesCorrespondingDirEvent.dirCorresponds`. I wasted an entire session going down the `eReq` rabbit hole.
- **ALWAYS document WHY a sublemma exists**: Write the protocol argument (e.g., "onDirVd is contradictory because an NC write between e_w and e_gdown violates NIW") BEFORE writing code. Include key terms (e_w, e_gdown, CLE_r, etc.). Without this, context is lost across sessions and you go in circles.
- **Add all needed hypotheses upfront, prune later.** When writing a lemma, aggressively add protocol hypotheses from the call site context. It's easy to remove unused params; it's painful to discover mid-proof that a hypothesis is missing. The `h_dir_req`, `h_eReq_in_b`, `h_cle_is_de`, `h_ncRead_prior_write`, `h_not_global`, `h_s_dir` parameters to `event_Vd_transition_implies_ncWrite_in_b` should have been added in the first draft.
- **`by_cases` on Bool fields is powerful.** `by_cases hisW : de_trans.eReq.req.val.isWrite` cleanly splits NC-read-on-Vd from NC-write cases. `by_cases hevict_down : e_evict.down` cleanly splits `sameCacheConstraints` vs `sameCacheWriteConstraints`.
- **Temporal chains through encapsulation**: `Encapsulates.2` gives `inner.oEnd < outer.oEnd`. Chain with `finishesBefore.endBefore` and `gcache_oEnd_lt_cle` for full CLE temporal bounds.
- **`list_stateAfter_exists_transition_with_inv`**: When the plain `list_stateAfter_exists_transition` loses context (like `s.isDirectoryState`), use the invariant-preserving variant. The invariant `Q` is preserved through the induction and returned with the transition evidence.
- **NC read on Vd → prior NC write**: If a `reqToDirOfRequestEvent` transforms a NC read (Acq/Weak) on Vd cache state to a Weak Write at the dir level, the cache event is a READ, not a write. The actual NC write is a PRIOR event that left the cache at Vd. Use `h_ncRead_prior_write` to delegate to the caller.
- **Check if a field is actually USED before refactoring to remove it.** `dirAccessUnique` was declared in `CompoundProtocol` but never referenced in any proof. I assumed it was needed based on its name and wrote that assumption into CLAUDE.md — then built a 55-error refactoring on top of that false premise. One `grep` would have shown it was unused. **Root cause**: I reasoned about what the field SHOULD do instead of checking what it ACTUALLY does. This is the same failure as "don't guess constructors" — verify before acting.
- **`compoundLin` refactor breaks `dir_ordered` fallback**: `dir_ordered` requires BOTH events to be directory events. CLEs are always directory events (by construction). But `compoundLin e` can be a cache event (when `requestLin`: the event has perms, so it linearizes at the cache, not the directory). This means `compose_three`'s universal fallback wouldn't work. The CLE-based approach is correct for the Herd proof.
- **CO ≠ RF carbon copy**: `readsFrom.cases` and `NoInterveningWrites` require `isRead` for the second event. CO has two writes. A CO theorem needs its own types (`co.ordering` is already defined). Don't blindly copy RF infrastructure for CO.

## Auto-habits
- `/protocol-proof` BEFORE and DURING implementing any sorry or writing/updating Lean definitions. Think about what the protocol actually does. Check existing Behaviour/proof files for reusable patterns.
- `/checkpoint` every ~15 min, after milestones, after corrections
- `/learn` after discovering patterns or user corrections — IMMEDIATELY
- `/reflect` every ~20-30 min: am I correct? efficient? going in circles?
- `/philosophy` before major decisions, when stuck
- `/imagine` BEFORE implementing: construct concrete scenarios, check if cases are vacuous
- `/band-aid-check` BEFORE implementing any workaround, fallback, or propagation of "temporary" state: Is this a band-aid or a real fix? Does this create technical debt? Is there a foundational fix that eliminates the problem entirely? Examples of band-aids: propagating reverseOB instead of eliminating it, sorry'ing a case instead of understanding why it arises, adding a new constructor instead of fixing the underlying composition logic. The cost of a band-aid is hours of future work; the cost of a real fix is minutes of thought now.
- **Git commit after implementing** — don't wait to batch commits
- **Think about protocol semantics** — always, constantly, before everything
